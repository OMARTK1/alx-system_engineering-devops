Issue Summary
Duration:
Start: April 10, 2024, 08:30 AM UTC
End: April 10, 2024, 11:45 AM UTC

Impact:
During the outage, users of the Auto Translation Discord Bot experienced significant delays in receiving automated translations and role assignments. Approximately 60% of users attempting to join channels were affected, experiencing delays of up to 10 minutes for role assignments and translations. This resulted in user frustration and a spike in support requests.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a memory leak in the bot's translation module, which led to excessive memory consumption, ultimately causing the server to become unresponsive. Additionally, the challenge of finding a free or inexpensive hosting server contributed to inadequate resources to handle the increased load.

Timeline
08:30 AM: Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating high memory usage on the server.
08:35 AM: Initial investigation by the on-call engineer confirmed the high memory usage but did not identify the root cause.
08:45 AM: Escalation to the development team for further investigation.
09:00 AM: Development team identified that the memory leak was in the translation module of the bot.
09:30 AM: Misleading debugging path: Initially suspected the issue was with the recent deployment of a new feature related to role assignments.
10:00 AM: After ruling out the new feature, focus shifted back to the translation module.
10:30 AM: Detailed code review of the translation module identified inefficient memory handling in the translation cache.
11:00 AM: Temporary fix applied by restarting the bot and clearing the cache to restore service.
11:30 AM: Permanent fix implemented by optimizing memory management in the translation module.
11:45 AM: Services fully restored and confirmed stable through monitoring and user feedback.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause
The memory leak was caused by inefficient handling of translation cache data within the bot's translation module. Specifically, translations were being stored indefinitely in the cache without any mechanism for clearing old or unused translations. This led to gradual accumulation of data, resulting in high memory usage and eventually causing the server to become unresponsive. Furthermore, the reliance on a free or inexpensive hosting server, which had limited resources, exacerbated the impact of the memory leak.

Resolution
To resolve the issue:

Implemented a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache for storing translations, ensuring that old or infrequently used translations are automatically removed from memory.
Upgraded to a more robust hosting solution with better resource allocation, within budget constraints.
Deployed the updated translation module to the new server.
Monitored the system post-deployment to ensure stability and proper memory management.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements
Enhanced Monitoring: Improve monitoring to include alerts for memory usage trends and potential leaks.
Code Reviews: Implement stricter code review processes for memory management, particularly in modules dealing with data storage and caching.
Testing: Develop comprehensive testing scenarios to simulate heavy load and prolonged usage to identify potential memory leaks.
Hosting Solutions: Evaluate and secure a more reliable and scalable hosting solution that balances cost and performance.
Tasks
Patch Translation Module:

Implement and deploy an LRU cache in the translation module.
Conduct rigorous testing of the updated module.
Improve Monitoring:

Add detailed memory usage monitoring for the bot.
Set up alerts for abnormal memory usage patterns.
Conduct Code Audits:

Perform a thorough audit of the codebase to identify other potential areas for memory leaks.
Ensure best practices for memory management are followed.
Upgrade Hosting:

Research and select a cost-effective hosting provider with better resource allocation.
Migrate the bot to the new hosting environment and perform stress tests.
User Communication:

Inform users about the issue, resolution, and steps taken to prevent future occurrences.
By addressing these areas, we aim to improve system resilience, prevent future outages, and enhance the overall user experience.
